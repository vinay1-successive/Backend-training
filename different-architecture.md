<h3>1. Monolithic Architecture:</h3>
   <h4>Description:</h4> A single, unified codebase and deployment package where all components of an application are interconnected.
   - <h4>Advantages:</h4> Simplicity, easier to develop and test, straightforward deployment.
   - <h4>Challenges:</h4> Scalability can be limited, updates may require downtime for the entire system.

<h3>2. Microservices Architecture:</h3>
   <h4>Description:</h4> Decomposes an application into small, independent services that communicate through APIs. Each service focuses on a specific business capability.
   - <h4>Advantages:</h4> Scalability, independent deployment of services, technology diversity.
   - <h4>Challenges:</h4> Increased complexity in managing distributed systems, potential communication overhead.

<h3>3. Serverless Architecture:</h3>
   <h4>Description:</h4> Also known as Function as a Service (FaaS), it allows developers to run individual functions in response to events without managing the underlying infrastructure.
   - <h4>Advantages:</h4> Automatic scaling, cost-effective as you pay per execution, no need to manage servers.
   - <h4>Challenges:</h4> Limited execution time for functions, potential cold start latency.

<h3>4. Event-Driven Architecture:</h3>
   <h4>Description:</h4> Components communicate through events. When an event occurs, it triggers the execution of specific functions or processes.
   - <h4>Advantages:</h4> Loose coupling between components, responsiveness to changes, scalable.
   - <h4>Challenges:</h4> Ensuring reliable event delivery, managing event schemas.

These architectures offer different solutions to address various requirements in terms of scalability, maintenance, and flexibility in software development. The choice depends on the specific needs and goals of the project.
