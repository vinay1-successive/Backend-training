Express is a versatile web framework that primarily operates through a series of middleware function calls. Here's an overview of its key concepts:

**Middleware Functions:**
Middleware functions in Express have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the next middleware function in the request-response cycle (commonly denoted as `next`).

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:
- Execute custom code.
- Modify the request and response objects.
- Terminate the request-response cycle.
- Call the next middleware function in the stack.

If a middleware function doesn't end the request-response cycle, it must call `next()` to pass control to the subsequent middleware function. Failure to do so will leave the request hanging.

**Types of Middleware in Express:**
1. **Application-level Middleware:**
   Application-level middleware is bound to an instance of the Express application using `app.use()` and `app.METHOD()` functions, where `METHOD` is the HTTP method (e.g., GET, PUT, POST) in lowercase.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();

   app.use((req,res,next) => {
     // Custom middleware logic
     console.log('Time:', Date.now());
     next();
   });
   ```

2. **Router-level Middleware:**
   Router-level middleware is similar to application-level middleware but is bound to an instance of `express.Router()`. It is used for specific routes.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   const router = express.Router();

   router.use('/user/:id', (req,res,next) => {
     // Middleware for a specific route
     console.log('Request Type:', req.method);
     next();
   });
   ```

3. **Error-handling Middleware:**
   Error-handling middleware functions take four arguments `(err, req,res,next)` and are used to handle errors during the request-response cycle.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   app.use((err, req,res,next) => {
     console.error(err.stack);
     res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
   });
   ```

4. **Built-in Middleware:**
   Express has built-in middleware functions, like `express.static` for serving static assets, `express.json` for parsing JSON payloads, and `express.urlencoded` for parsing URL-encoded payloads.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();

   app.use(express.static('public'));
   app.use(express.json());
   ```

5. **Third-party Middleware:**
   Third-party middleware adds functionality to Express apps. Install the module, then load it in your app.

   Example:
   ```bash
   $ npm install cookie-parser
   ```

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');

   app.use(cookieParser());
   ```

Express's modular approach to middleware allows developers to efficiently structure and extend their applications based on specific needs.
